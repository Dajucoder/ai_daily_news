# Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the AI Daily News platform, including completed milestones and potential future work.

## Current Status

**As of August 2025, the project has achieved its initial goals:**

-   **Full-Stack Implementation**: A complete, functional platform with a React frontend, Django backend, and Python agent.
-   **Core Feature Complete**: The system successfully fetches, processes, and displays AI news.
-   **Containerization with Docker**: The entire application has been fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, enabling a simple, one-command setup for development and deployment.

## Completed Milestones

-   **Phase 1: Initial Scaffolding (Completed)**
    -   [x] Set up project structure for frontend, backend, and agent.
    -   [x] Implemented basic models and API endpoints in Django.
    -   [x] Created initial React components for the UI.

-   **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Completed)**
    -   [x] Developed RSS fetching capabilities in the AI agent.
    -   [x] Integrated AI services for news summarization and categorization.
    -   [x] Implemented user authentication and profile management.
    -   [x] Built frontend views for news display, dashboards, and user login.

-   **Phase 3: Deployment & Refinement (Completed)**
    -   [x] **Dockerized all services (frontend, backend, agent, database).**
    -   [x] **Created a unified `docker-compose.yml` for one-command startup.**
    -   [x] **Centralized configuration into a single `.env` file.**
    -   [x] **Updated all documentation to reflect the Docker-based workflow.**

## Future Work & Potential Enhancements

This section outlines potential areas for future development to enhance the platform.

### High Priority

-   **Production Hardening**:
    -   Implement a robust logging solution (e.g., ELK stack or cloud-based logging).
    -   Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all services.
    -   Configure HTTPS for the Nginx service in a production environment.
    -   Use a production-grade WSGI server for the Flask-based agent (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI).

-   **Enhanced User Experience**:
    -   Implement real-time notifications for newly fetched news (e.g., using WebSockets).
    -   Add user preferences for news sources and topics.
    -   Improve dashboard visualizations and analytics.

### Medium Priority

-   **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    -   Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically test and build Docker images on push.
    -   Automate deployment to a staging or production environment.

-   **Scalability**:
    -   Introduce a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve API response times.
    -   Implement a background task queue (e.g., Celery) for handling long-running processes like news fetching, instead of using Flask's threading.

### Low Priority

-   **Advanced AI Features**:
    -   Implement sentiment analysis for news articles.
    -   Develop a trend analysis feature to identify recurring topics over time.
    -   Create a recommendation engine to suggest articles to users based on their reading history.

-   **Social Features**:
    -   Allow users to comment on or share articles.
    -   Add social login options (e.g., Google, GitHub).
